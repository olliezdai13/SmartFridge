Time to make some new UI components, visualizations, and update the Dashboard.

Dashboard: UI component & major route
- Features a carousel UI component with a list of SnapshotCard

SnapshotCard: UI component 
- A portrait-orientation card with gently rounded corners
- at the top, should show the latest fridge picture
- at the bottom, should have a list of the latest fridge contents and quantities
- the Dashboard's carousel component renders these, and you can flip to prior / latter cards (no cycle)
